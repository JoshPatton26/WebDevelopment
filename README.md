# Web Development Projects Repository

Welcome to my Web Development projects repository! This repository houses a collection of projects related to web development, including HTML, CSS, Python, databases such as SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy, Flask framework, and more.

## Project Overview

### Advanced Web Development Assignments
This section contains assignments from my Advanced Web Development class at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). These assignments cover a range of topics including frontend and backend development, database integration, API usage, authentication, and more.

### E-Commerce Store Project
The centerpiece of this repository is my advanced web development final project: an e-commerce store for a fictional produce wholesale company. This project demonstrates proficiency in frontend design, backend development with Flask, database management using SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy, user authentication, and more.

### Password Manager
In addition to course projects, this repository includes a password manager application developed during my free time. The password manager utilizes MD5 encryption for secure storage and SQLite3 databases for data management. It provides a practical solution for securely managing and storing passwords.

## Development Environment

### Tools and Technologies
- **HTML and CSS:** Used for structuring and styling web pages to create visually appealing and responsive designs.
- **Python:** Utilized for backend development, including server-side scripting and business logic implementation.
- **Flask Framework:** Employed for building web applications and APIs with Python.
- **Databases:** Leveraged SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy for database management, querying, and data manipulation.

## Running the Projects

Each project directory contains instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, Flask, and any required libraries. Additionally, database setup instructions will be provided if applicable.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or feature requests for the projects, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome, and your input can help enhance the quality and functionality of the projects.
